I also maintain a secondary GitHub account at [**AshongAbdallah06**](https://github.com/AshongAbdallah06).

This account contains:
- Other works yet to be transferred here
- Legacy code from earlier projects.
- Archived experiments and prototypes.
- Some useful components and utilities I occasionally pull into current work.

I keep it linked for **transparency and completeness**, but all ongoing and production-quality projects are housed here on `ashongdev`.
